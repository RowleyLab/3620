	\item [Exercise 7D.8(a)] ~ (5 points)
	
	An electron is confined to a square well of length $L$. What would be the length of the box such that the zero-point energy of the electron is equal to its rest mass energy, $m_ec^2$? Express your answer in terms of the parameter $\lambda_C=\nicefrac{h}{m_ec}$, the ``Compton wavelength'' of the electron.

	\item [Exercise 7D.9(a)] ~ (5 points)
	
	For a particle in a box of length $L$  and in the state with $n=3$, at what positions is the probability density at a maximum? At what positions is the probability density zero?

	Suppose that a proton of an acidic hydrogen atom is confined to an acid that can be represented by a barrier of height $2.0~eV$ and length $100~pm$. Calculate the probability that a proton with energy $1.4~eV$ can escape from the acid.

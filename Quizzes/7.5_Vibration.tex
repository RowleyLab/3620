\subsection*{Harmonic Oscillator}
Consider a quantum mechanical harmonic oscillator with mass equal to $8.5~AMU$ and a force constant of $400\dfrac{N}{m}$. What will be the zero-point energy in ($J$) for this system?

\vspace{5em}\noindent
Consider the same quantum mechanical harmonic oscillator introduced above in the first excited state ($v=1$). The normalization constant for this state is: $N_1=1.94\times10^6$. You are interested in finding the probability that the oscillator will be found with a displacement between $x=-0.1~pm$ and $x=0.1~pm$.

\noindent
Give the integral which you would evaluate to find that probability (including the appropriate limits of integration). Also, sketch the probability distribution function with the integrated area shaded.

\subsection*{Harmonic Oscillator}
\ch{O2} vibrations can me modeled as a quantum mechanical harmonic oscillator with reduced mass equal to $8.0~AMU$ and a force constant of $1138\dfrac{N}{m}$. Give the fundamental angular frequency ($\omega$), fundamental linear frequency ($\nu$), and zero-point energy for oxygen vibrations.

\vspace{20em}\noindent
Write the wavefunction for the first three states of a harmonic oscillator. You  may use generic symbols for $N$ and $\alpha$, but you must expand the Hermite polynomials.

\vspace{20em}\noindent
Give the energies of these three states, and sketch their wavefunctions on a potential energy curve.

\vspace{20em}\noindent
Give the classical maximum displacement for each of these three states, both in $pm$ and in \% of the equilibrium \ch{O2} bond length ($121~pm$)

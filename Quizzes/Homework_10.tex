	\section*{Problem 1 (10 points)}
	
	\ch{O2^{4+}} and \ch{N2^{2+}} have the same number of electrons, so you might expect them to have identical electronic structure
	
	\noindent $\circ$ Draw the molecular orbital energy level diagram for these two molecules, filled with the proper number of electrons
	
	\vspace{30em}
	\noindent $\circ$ Give the bond order of both molecules
	
	\vspace{5em}
	\noindent $\circ$ Describe how both molecules might interact with a strong magnetic field

	\newpage
	\section*{Problem 2 (20 points)}
	
	Consider the molecule HF. Because of the much higher nuclear charge on F, the H$1s$ orbital actually aligns best energetically with the F$2p_z$ orbital, so they are the two which combine to form a molecular orbital. $\alpha_{H1s} = -7.2eV$, $\alpha_{F2p}=-10.4eV$, and $\beta_{H1s-F2p}=-1.0eV$
	
	\noindent $\circ$ Calculate the energies of the two molecular orbitals, and draw an energy-level diagram which includes both the energies of the atomic orbitals and molecular orbitals.
	
	\vspace{27em}
	\noindent $\circ$ Calculate the coefficients for both MOs and sketch how they might look considering the unequal contributions from both atoms
	
	\newpage
	\section*{Problem 3 (20 points)}	
	$\circ$ Show the H\"uckel theory determinant for 1,3,5 hexatriene. You may either show the matrix populated with $\alpha$ and $\beta$ terms, or the simplified matrix with only $1$s and $0$s
	
	\vspace{25em}
	
	\noindent$\circ$ Solve for the energy levels (You may use WolframAlpha or similar software to either find the determinant or diagonalize the matrix) and draw the energy level diagram
	
	\vspace{15em}
	\noindent $\circ$ Give the total bonding energy of the π system, as well as the resonance stabilization energy
	
	\newpage
	\section*{Problem 4 (20 points)}
		$\circ$ Show the H\"uckel theory determinant for benzene. You may either show the matrix populated with $\alpha$ and $\beta$ terms, or the simplified matrix with only $1$s and $0$s
	
	\vspace{25em}
	
	\noindent$\circ$ Solve for the energy levels (You may use WolframAlpha or similar software to either find the determinant or diagonalize the matrix) and draw the energy level diagram
	
	\vspace{15em}
	\noindent $\circ$ Give the total bonding energy of the π system, as well as the resonance stabilization energy
	
	\vspace{5em}
	\noindent $\circ$ Compare these values to those found for 1,3,5 hexatriene and comment on why they are different

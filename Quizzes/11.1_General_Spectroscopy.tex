Find the doppler broadening width (in $cm^{-1}$) for two gas samples, with $v_{avg}=425~\nicefrac{m}{s}$ and $v_{avg}=1650~\nicefrac{m}{s}$

\vspace{10em}\noindent
An \ch{O2} gas molecule at standard temperature and pressure will undergo a collision about every $100~ps$. Find the lifetime broadening width (in $cm^{-1}$), assuming that the excited state lifetime is limited by molecular collisions.

\vspace{10em}\noindent
An \ch{O2} gas molecule under very low pressures (say, within a nebular cloud in space) may undergo a collision about every $5~s$. Find the lifetime broadening width (in $cm^{-1}$), assuming that the excited state lifetime is limited by molecular collisions.

\subsection*{Valence Bond Theory}
Consider an \ch{F2} molecule from the perspective of valence bond theory. Draw the orbital overlap which leads to the covalent bond in \ch{F2}

\subsection*{Hybridization}
For each class of hybridization, give the linear combination that forms one of the hybrid orbitals

	\item $sp$

	\item $sp^2$

\subsection*{Variational Theory}
For a particle in a box with length $L=1$, the ground state wavefunction is $\Psi=\sqrt{2}\sin(\pi x)$ and the ground state energy is $\dfrac{h^2}{8m}$

\noindent The normalized trial function $\phi=\sqrt{30}\left(-x^2+x\right)$ has a similar shape and obeys the same boundary conditions. Demonstrate the variational theory by finding the energy expectation value $\matrixel{\phi}{\hat{H}}{\phi}$ and comparing it to the true ground state energy.

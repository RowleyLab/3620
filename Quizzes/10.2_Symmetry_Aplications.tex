\subsection*{Irreducible Representations}
Consider the ammonia molecule, which belongs to the $C_{3v}$ symmetry point group. Below are figures showing the molecular orbitals and normal modes of ammonia. Assign each feature to the correct irreducible representation of the $C_{3v}$ point group.

\hspace{-4em}\noindent\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{AmmoniaMOs}
\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{AmmoniaModes}

\noindent
Which (if any) of the vibrational modes are ``silent'' in IR or Raman spectra

\vspace{6em}\noindent
Is the HOMO-LUMO transition allowed by symmetry? If so, what direction of light polarization can induce the transition?

\section*{\emph{God Says Yes to Me}}
\paragraph{By Kaylin Haught}~
\begin{verse}
	I asked God if it was okay to be melodramatic\\
	and she said yes\\
	I asked her if it was okay to be short\\
	and she said it sure is\\
	I asked her if I could wear nail polish\\
	or not wear nail polish\\
	and she said honey\\
	she calls me that sometimes\\
	she said you can do just exactly\\
	what you want to\\
	Thanks God I said\\
	And is it even okay if I don’t paragraph\\
	my letters\\
	Sweetcakes God said\\
	who knows where she picked that up\\
	what I’m telling you is\\
	Yes Yes Yes

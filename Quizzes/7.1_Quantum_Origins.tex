\subsection*{Early QM Experiments}
Sodium metal has a work function of $2.28~eV$. If sodium metal is irradiated with $450~nm$ light, what will be the kinetic energy of the ejected photoelectrons?


\vspace{7em}\noindent
Find the velocity of the ejected photoelectrons in the above example?

\vspace{7em}\noindent
Find the de Broglie wavelength of the ejected photoelectrons in the above example?

\vspace{7em}
\subsection*{Bohr Model}
The ``Bohr radius'' is $52.9~pm$. The Bohr model has the electrons revolving around the nucleus in an orbit at that radius. Assuming that the ground state must have a single wavelength equal to the orbital circumference, find the velocity of the electron in its orbit.

\vspace{7em}\noindent
Find the kinetic energy of the electron in the ground state of the Bohr model, and compare it to the true hydrogen atom ground state energy ($-2.18\times10^{-18}J$)

\section*{\emph{When I Heard the Learn'd Astronomer}}
\paragraph{By Walt Whitman}~

\begin{verse}
	When I heard the learn’d astronomer,\\
	When the proofs, the figures, were ranged in columns before me,\\
	When I was shown the charts and diagrams, to add, divide, and measure them,\\
	When I sitting heard the astronomer where he lectured with much applause in the lecture-room,\\
	How soon unaccountable I became tired and sick,\\
	Till rising and gliding out I wander’d off by myself,\\
	In the mystical moist night-air, and from time to time,\\
	Look’d up in perfect silence at the stars.
\end{verse}

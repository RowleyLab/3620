\subsection*{Early QM Experiments}
Sodium metal has a work function of $2.28~eV$. If sodium metal is irradiated with $450~nm$ light, what will be the kinetic energy of the ejected photoelectrons?


\vspace{7em}\noindent
Find the velocity of the ejected photoelectrons in the above example?

\vspace{7em}\noindent
Find the de Broglie wavelength of the ejected photoelectrons in the above example? 

\vspace{7em}
\subsection*{Bohr Model}
The ``Bohr radius'' is $52.9~pm$. The Bohr model has the electrons revolving around the nucleus in an orbit at that radius. Assuming that the ground state must have a single wavelength equal to the orbital circumference, find the velocity of the electron in its orbit.

\vspace{7em}\noindent
Find the kinetic energy of the electron in the ground state of the Bohr model, and compare it to the true hydrogen atom ground state energy ($-2.18\times10^{-18}J$)

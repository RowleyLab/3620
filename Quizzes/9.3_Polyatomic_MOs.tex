\subsection*{Resonance in 1,3,5 hexatriene}
$\circ$ Show the H\"uckel theory determinant for 1,3,5 hexatriene. You may either show the matrix populated with $\alpha$ and $\beta$ terms, or the simplified matrix with only $1$s and $0$s

\vspace{22em}

\noindent$\circ$ Solve for the energy levels (You may use WolframAlpha or similar software to either find the determinant or diagonalize the matrix) and draw the energy level diagram

\vspace{15em}
\noindent $\circ$ Give the total bonding energy of the π system, as well as the resonance stabilization energy

\newpage
\subsection*{Resonance in benzene}
$\circ$ Show the H\"uckel theory determinant for benzene. You may either show the matrix populated with $\alpha$ and $\beta$ terms, or the simplified matrix with only $1$s and $0$s

\vspace{22em}

\noindent$\circ$ Solve for the energy levels (You may use WolframAlpha or similar software to either find the determinant or diagonalize the matrix) and draw the energy level diagram

\vspace{15em}
\noindent $\circ$ Give the total bonding energy of the π system, as well as the resonance stabilization energy

\vspace{5em}
\noindent $\circ$ Compare these values to those found for 1,3,5 hexatriene and comment on why they are different

\section*{\emph{Your World}}
\paragraph{By Georgia Douglas Johnson}~
\begin{verse}
	Your world is as big as you make it.\\
	I know, for I used to abide\\
	In the narrowest nest in a corner,\\
	My wings pressing close to my side.

	But I sighted the distant horizon\\
	Where the skyline encircled the sea\\
	And I throbbed with a burning desire\\
	To travel this immensity.

	I battered the cordons around me\\
	And cradled my wings on the breeze,\\
	Then soared to the uttermost reaches\\
	With rapture, with power, with ease!
\end{verse}

\subsection*{Wavefunction Normalization}
The wavefunction for a 1s electron orbital is:
\begin{equation*}
	\psi_{1s}(r,\theta,\phi) = e^{-\nicefrac{r}{a_0}}
\end{equation*}

\noindent
Note that this is a function in spherical polar coordinates, and that $a_0$ is the Bohr radius. Find the normalization constant, and give the complete normalized wavefunction $\psi_{1s}(r,\theta,\phi)$

\vspace{12em}
\subsection*{Expectation Values}
For electronic orbitals, we can define an orbital angular momentum operator: $\hat{l}^2$

\noindent Some eigenvalues are:

$\hat{l}^2\psi_{3s} = 0$

$\hat{l}^2\psi_{3p} = 2 \hbar^2\psi_{3p}$

$\hat{l}^2\psi_{3d} = 6 \hbar^2\psi_{3d}$

\noindent
If an electron is in the superposition state $\Psi = \left(\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\psi_{3s} + \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\psi_{3p} + \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{6}}\psi_{3d}\right)$, what will be the expectation value $\avg{\hat{l}^2}$?

\subsection{Schr\"odinger Equation and Wavefunctions}

For a particle confined in the region $0\leq x \leq L$, the appropriate wavefunctions are:
\begin{equation*}
	\psi_n(x) = \sqrt{\dfrac{2}{L}}\sin{\frac{n\pi x}{L}}
\end{equation*}

\noindent
$\circ$ Another function, $\phi(x) = -4x^2+4x$ has a similar shape and obeys the same boundary conditions. Prove whether or not this function is also a solution to the Schr\"odinger equation.

\vspace{10em}\noindent
$\circ$ Find the average position $\avg{x}$ for the states $n=1$ and $n=2$

\vspace{13em}\noindent
$\circ$ Assume $L=1$, and give the probability that the system is observed with $0.4<x<0.6$ for the states $n=1$ and $n=2$

\section*{\emph{Caged Bird}}
\paragraph{By Maya Angelou}~
\begin{verse}
	A free bird leaps\\
	on the back of the wind\\
	and floats downstream\\
	till the current ends\\
	and dips his wing\\
	in the orange sun rays\\
	and dares to claim the sky.

	But a bird that stalks\\
	down his narrow cage\\
	can seldom see through\\
	his bars of rage\\
	his wings are clipped and\\
	his feet are tied\\
	so he opens his throat to sing.

	The caged bird sings\\
	with a fearful trill\\
	of things unknown\\
	but longed for still\\
	and his tune is heard\\
	on the distant hill\\
	for the caged bird\\
	sings of freedom.

	The free bird thinks of another breeze\\
	and the trade winds soft through the sighing trees\\
	and the fat worms waiting on a dawn bright lawn\\
	and he names the sky his own

	But a caged bird stands on the grave of dreams\\
	his shadow shouts on a nightmare scream\\
	his wings are clipped and his feet are tied\\
	so he opens his throat to sing.\\

	The caged bird sings\\
	with a fearful trill\\
	of things unknown\\
	but longed for still\\
	and his tune is heard\\
	on the distant hill\\
	for the caged bird\\
	sings of freedom.\\
\end{verse}

\section*{Course Description}
This course will provide an introduction to quantum mechanics, a topic that is the foundation of all chemistry. During the turn of the \nth{20} century many scientists believed that all of the major questions about science had already been answered and all that was needed was a little refinement. However, led by the experimental discoveries and theoretical models of Einstein, Planck, de Broglie, and others, the scientific world was turned upside down and the miniature physical world of quantum mechanics was discovered. This course will focus on quantum mechanics; full understanding of this topic will require proficient math skills. Therefore, it is highly recommended that students review the math chapters in the text.

\paragraph{Prerequisites:}
A minimum grade of C (2.0 or above) in CHEM 1220/1225 and Math 1220, and admission to the Chemistry program.

\paragraph{Concurrent requisite:}
CHEM 3625 -- Physical Chemistry Lab II

\paragraph{Course Materials:} ~

\paragraph{Student Learning Outcomes:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item{Students will successfully identify and understand the experiments that led to the discovery of quantum mechanics.}
	\item{Students will understand and utilize the fundamental quantum mechanical Schr√∂dinger equation.}
	\item{Students will generate and apply the following mathematical models to real systems:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item{Particle in a Box}
		\item{Harmonic Oscillator}
		\item{Rigid Rotor}
	\end{itemize}
	\item{Students will understand how the quantum mechanical models can be used in spectroscopy to predict various structural and chemical properties.}
	\item{Students will learn about group theory and how combining it with quantum mechanics provides a powerful tool for understanding the consequences of molecular symmetry (atomic orbital contributions to molecular orbitals, the origin of selection rules, identify the normal modes of vibration for molecules, and determine IR/Raman activity.}
\end{itemize}

\section*{Tentative Schedule}
This class will meet on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays from 12:00 pm to 12:50 pm in room 128 of the Science Center (SC).

\end{tabular}
\paragraph{Midterm Exams:}
There are four midterm exams, to be completed in the testing center unless prior arrangements have been made. It is departmental policy that exams not be returned, although students may examine their completed exam and the answer key in my office. Scantron sheets are not required for midterms.

\paragraph{Final Exam:}
The final exam is comprehensive. The final is produced by the American Chemical Society, and the instructor will not have access to the exam prior to its administration. Therefore, it is to your advantage to learn as much as possible throughout the semester. The test is multiple choice and a scantron will be required.

\paragraph{Homework:}
The homework assignments will be a combination of problems from the textbook as well as problems that I have written or gathered from various other resources. These assignments are designed to be somewhat challenging and will require diligence in order to complete. They sometimes push the students to think \emph{beyond} the lecture material.

\paragraph{Quizzes:}
Quizzes will be shorter and more frequent assignments than the regular homework. The difficulty and scope of the questions on quizzes will more closely match what you will see on the exams.

\paragraph{Attendance Policy:}
Students are expected to attend class. If you must miss class, contact the instructor.

\paragraph{Make-up Work Policy:}
In general, there will be no opportunity to make up missed work. If you must miss class, please do any assigned work in advance, and arrange to turn it in early.

\section*{Miscellany}

\paragraph{Important syllabus statements related to ATTENDANCE and COVID-19:} ~

\noindent\emph{What should I expect in the classroom this semester?}

\noindent The following are general guidelines for the classroom environment
\begin{description}
	\item[Class Attendance is Required:] If you are registered for a Face-to-Face, Synchronous Remote, or Hybrid course, attendance is required. If you are ill or instructed to isolate or quarantine, you may request a faculty member record the class and share it with you or you may request other reasonable accommodations. Your instructor will work with you to develop a plan for completing coursework while you are isolated/quarantined. In order for you to receive academic accommodations and ensure that your request is communicated to faculty, you must submit this \href{https://my.suu.edu/covid/selfreport/}{self report form}.
	\item[\href{https://www.suu.edu/registrar/onlinehybrid.html}{Course ~delivery ~modalities} ~are ~posted ~online ~for ~each ~course, ~but ~may ~be ~modified ~in] \textbf{response to emerging COVID conditions:} SUU is employing every effort to maintain a learning environment that is engaging and safe. The course modality listed when you registered for courses should remain for the semester; however, due to COVID conditions, the delivery of modality for a specific course may change during the semester. Normally, these changes will be short term (possibly the length of a quarantine or isolation time period), or in some cases longer. When such a modification is needed, faculty members will work with their department chair and/or dean and the students to maintain an effective learning environment.
\end{description}

\paragraph{Scientific Calculator:}
There are many different ways to calculate figures during homework. It is tempting to rely on Online resources such as \href{http://www.wolframalpha.com}{http://www.wolframalpha.com}, or to simply use a calculator application on a smart phone. During exams, however, any devices capable of connecting to the Internet will \emph{not} be allowed. You will instead need a scientific calculator capable of performing exponentiation and logarithms for the exams. Using this calculator exclusively while doing homework will ensure that you are familiar with it for use during exams.

\paragraph{Academic Integrity:}
Scholastic dishonesty will not be tolerated and will be prosecuted to the fullest extent (see \href{https://www.suu.edu/policies/06/33.html}{SUU Policy 6.33}). You are expected to have read and understood the current SUU student conduct code (\href{https://www.suu.edu/policies/11/02.html}{SUU Policy 11.2}) regarding student responsibilities and rights, the intellectual property policy (\href{https://www.suu.edu/policies/05/52.html}{SUU Policy 5.52}), information about procedures, and what constitutes acceptable behavior.
